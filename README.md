# ML_Fundamentals
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) that trace a learning path for learning the fundamentals of machine learning. The first four chapters are closely based on the book: 
```text
Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (3rd ed.) by Aurélien Géron (2022).
```
From Chapter 5 onwards, I will use other relevant and well-recognized literature:
