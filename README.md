“This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) based on Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (3rd ed.) by Aurélien Géron (2022). The notebooks serve as an interactive companion to the book, implementing key concepts, algorithms, and exercises in Python.”
